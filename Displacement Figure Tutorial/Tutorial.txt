Eigenvector displacement image tutorial for a dimer

You will need:
A frequency output file (named output.txt)
Mercury

1.
Paste Freq output file into folder and name it output.txt

2.
Run cifmaker.py

3.
Open this cif in mercury and add/delete molecules until you are happy

4.
Save this as a new cif  (name it CIF_FROM_MERCURY.cif) and a xyz file

5.
Open main.py and enter the mode that you want to visualize (ModeNumber = # in the second loop), then run code.py

6.
Open VMD and load in the xyz you made in step 4, and from the console used to open VMD type 'source run_modes.tcl'

7.
Load the visualization state "VMD_Vis_State" from the folder

8. Render the file in vmd as a tachyon

9. enter a new terminal in where the .dat file was created and run:
./tachyonWIN32.exe YOURFILE.dat -aasamples 12 -res 8000 6000 -format BMP -o output.bmp
